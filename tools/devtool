# Firecracker devtool
#
# Use this script to build and test Firecracker.
#
# TL;DR
# Make sure you have Docker installed and properly configured
# (http://docker.com). Then,
#   building: `./devtool build`
#     Then find the binaries under build/debug/
#   testing: `./devtool test`
#     Will run the entire test battery; will take serveral minutes to complete.
#   deep-dive: `./devtool shell`
#     Open a shell prompt inside the container. Then build or test (or do
#     anything, really) manually.
#
# Still TL;DR: have Docker; ./devtool build; ./devtool test; ./devtool help.
#
#
# Both building and testing are done inside a Docker container. Please make sure
# you have Docker up and running on your system (see http:/docker.com) and your
# user has permission to run Docker containers.
#
# The Firecracker sources dir will be bind-mounted inside the development
# container (under /firecracker) and any files generated by the build process
# will show up under the build/ dir.  This includes the final binaries, as well
# as any intermediate or cache files.
#
# By default, all devtool commands run the container transparently, removing
# it after the command completes. Any persisting files will be stored under
# build/.
# If, for any reason, you want to access the container directly, please use
# `devtool shell`. This will perform the initial setup (bind-mounting the
# sources dir, setting privileges) and will then drop into a BASH shell inside
# the container.
#
# Building:
#   Run `./devtool build`.
#   By default, the debug binaries are built and placed under build/debug/.
#   To build the release version, run `./devtool build --release` instead.
#   You can then find the binaries under build/release/.
#
# Testing:
#   Run `./devtool test`.
#   This will run the entire integration test battery. The testing system is
#   based on pytest (http://pytest.org).
#
# Opening a shell prompt inside the development container:
#   Run `./devtool shell`.
#
# Additional information:
#   Run `./devtool help`.
#
#
# TODO:
#   - Cache test binaries, preserving them across `./devtool test` invocations.
#     At the moment, Firecracker is rebuilt everytime a test is run.
#   - List tests by parsing the `pytest --collect-only` output.
#   - Implement test filtering with `./devtool test --filter <filter>`
#   - Find an easier way to run individual tests on existing binaries.
#   - Add a `./devtool run` command to set up and run Firecracker.
#   - Add a `./devtool diag` command to help with troubleshooting, by checking
#     the most common failure conditions.
#   - Add a `./devtool build-devctr` command to build the development container
#     from its Dockerfile.
#   - Look into caching the Cargo registry within the container and if that
#     would help with reproducible builds (in addition to pinning Cargo.lock)

# Development container image (name:tag)
# This should be updated whenever we upgrade the development container.
# (Yet another step on our way to reproducible builds.)
